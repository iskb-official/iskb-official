## 🔬 Featured project

### 🚗 Traffic Sign Recognition for Autonomous Vehicles

**Repo:** [`Optimizing-Traffic-Sign-Recognition-for-Autonomous-Vehichles-Using-SSD-MobileNet_v2`](https://github.com/iskb-official/Optimizing-Traffic-Sign-Recognition-for-Autonomous-Vehichles-Using-SSD-MobileNet_v2)  

- Uses **SSD MobileNet v2** for real‑time traffic‑sign detection and recognition.
- Focuses on **efficiency** (FPS) and **accuracy**, making it suitable for embedded or on‑car systems.
- Covers the full pipeline: data preparation, training, evaluation, and inference.

> This project reflects a strong interest in computer vision, deep learning, and autonomous driving applications.[web:145][web:148]
